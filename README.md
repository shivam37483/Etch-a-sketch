# Etch-a-sketch
Created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum.

# Thoughts
This project is a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. It was a really good exercise to develop my DOM manipulation skills. 

I will be coming back and improving this project by adding muiltiple functionalities like better design, multiple colour choices and much more once I have enough projects under my belt so stay tuned!
